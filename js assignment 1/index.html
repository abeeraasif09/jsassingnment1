<!-- question 1 -->
<h4> What is the HTML syntax to add an external JavaScript file? </h4>
<!-- answer -->
<h2 style="color: chocolate;">Answer</h2>

To include an external JavaScript file, we can use the script tag with the attribute src . You've already used the src attribute when using images. The value for the src attribute should be the path to your JavaScript file.
<script src="script.js"></script>

<!-- qustion 2 -->
 <h4> 2. Can you run JavaScript in a file with a JS extension in your browser?</h4>
<!-- answer -->
<h2 style="color: chocolate;">Answer</h2>
<p>To execute JavaScript in a browser you have two options â€” either put it inside a script element anywhere inside an HTML document, or put it inside an external JavaScript file (with a . js extension) and then reference that file inside the HTML document using an empty script element with a src attribute.</p>

<!-- question 3 -->

<h4>3. How do you write a multiple-line comment in JavaScript?</h4>

<!-- answer -->

<h2 style="color: chocolate;">Answer</h2>
<p>Multi-line comments in JavaScript code can be added by writing the comment between a forward-slash followed by asterisk /* and asterisk followed by a forward-slash */ . Below are some examples of multi-line comments.</p>

<!-- question 4 -->
<h4 style="color: chocolate;">4. What is the best way to remove a line of code from running that you might
    want to keep as you debug?</h4>

    <!-- answer -->

    <h2 style="color: chocolate;">Answer</h2>

    <p style="line-height: 40px;"> Locate the line of code you want to disable <br>

        Place two forward slashes // at the beginning of the line. For example: 
         Placing // at the start of a line turns it into a comment, and the JavaScript interpreter will ignore it. <br>

        Save your code. <br>
        
        By commenting out a line of code, you effectively "disable" it temporarily. This allows you to test your code without that particular line of code running. When you're done debugging and want to re-enable the line, simply remove the // characters, and the code will run as usual.
